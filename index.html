                <h2>Subway</h2>
                <p>
                    This was the first job I ever did. I started this job my first summer of college. It was pretty easy and met some pretty cool people.
                     Also some pretty weird ones as well. I like this job because it was my first job and wasn't too difficult, but it got me out therem and
                     allowed me to get more accustomed to many different people. There have been very interesting stories working there. I have worked there 
                     every now and then during my breaks. It is always fun to see people still there that I worked with whenever me and my family eat at subway.

                <h2>Kanakuk Kamps</h2>
                <p>
                    My second job was to be a camp couselor at a Christian Sports camp called Kanakuk. They are based in Branson, MO and I was in one of
                    their seven camps called K-Kountry. It is the runt of all the camps for its size, and because we have the youngest kids ranging from
                    6-11 years old. This job has been probably my favorite.

                <h2>Math Tutor</h2>
                <p>
                    This is the job that I currently am doing now. This is my second semester doing it. I never thought I would be good at helping others 
                    in math because I thought I couldn't explain it well. However it turns out that I am actually pretty decent at teaching others math and 
                    am requested a lot to help people privately through the support center through the school. I am decent at math, but there are other people that work with me that are 
                    far better than I am. I am very good with people and even if I don't know something I can always learn and find out. This job has been maybe the most rewarding
                    in the sense that when people tell me they did better on their test because they came to get help.               
                </p>
